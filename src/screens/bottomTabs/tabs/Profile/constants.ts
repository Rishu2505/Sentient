  info: `I'm a seasoned React Native Engineer from India with over 8 years of experience designing, developing, and optimizing high-performance cross-platform mobile apps.
  
My expertise includes React Native, TypeScript, JavaScript, Redux, Supabase, Zustand, React Navigation, and integration of RESTful and GraphQL APIs. I’ve worked extensively with video technologies like Mux HLS and AWS (S3, CloudFront), implementing features such as video caching, offline playback, adaptive streaming, and media optimization.
  
I also specialize in building complex UI/UX flows with FlatList, animations, gesture handlers, deep linking, playlist systems, and upload queues. I'm experienced in app state management, push notifications, and background tasks for a seamless user experience.
  
In addition, I have hands-on experience with CI/CD pipelines and mobile app deployment using tools like Fastlane, Bitrise, and App Store Connect for seamless publishing and updates on both iOS and Android platforms.
  
I follow a strong testing culture—using Jest, React Native Testing Library, and Detox—to ensure quality and maintainability.
  
Currently based in India, I’m equipped with a full remote setup (MacBook, iOS/Android devices, reliable internet, ergonomic workspace).
  
I’m an immediate joiner, open to full-time/part-time or contract roles.
